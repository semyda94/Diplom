Please note, that master branch of our git repository is supposed to be
an unstable branch. For stable code, please switch to the one of the version
branches such as 0.10.x.

Prerequisites
=============

You will need to have installed the following software. Header
files (-dev or -devel packages) of the following libraries are
also needed to compile libnetconf.

- libxml2
  http://xmlsoft.org

- libssh
  Version 0.6.4 or greater is recomended.
  http://www.libssh.org

  To disable usage of the libssh, use:

  $ ./configure --disable-libssh

  In such a case, libnetconf will use standalone ssh(1) client
  application to connect NETCONF client to the NETCONF server.
  ssh(1) is available as a part of the OpenSSH.

- DBus
  libdbus version 1.0.0 or greater
  http://dbus.freedesktop.org

  DBus is required by the NETCONF Notifications subsystem. If the
  Notifications support is switched off, DBus is no more needed:

  $ ./configure --disable-notifications

These items are conditional.

- OpenSSL
  Always the newest version is recommended, to ensure maximum
  security.
  https://www.openssl.org

  OpenSSL is required only if compiling with either

  $ ./configure --enable-tls

  or

  $ ./configure --enable-dnssec

  or both.

- dnsval (libval)
  Version 2.0 or greater
  http://dnssec-tools.org

  Required when compiling with

  $ ./configure --enable-dnssec

  to enable DNSSEC data retrieval and validation - automatic server SSH
  key acceptance. In that case, the following is performed once a client
  tries to connect to a server:

  - DNSSEC query is sent with the server hostname asking for SSHFP entries
  - then any answers are carefully checked and then compared to
    the key fingerprint presented by the server
  - only if an exact match is found and DNSSEC was used for the fingerprint
    retrieval is user input skipped and key is accepted (but it is NOT added
    into the known_hosts file!)

The remaining items are optional.

- doxygen
  Used to generate documentation from the source code.
  Version 1.8.0 or greater is recommended.
  http://www.doxygen.org

- rpmbuild
  Used to build RPM package.
  http://www.rpm.org


Building / Installation
=======================

To install libnetconf with default options:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

This way the library will be installed in /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/include respectively. Configure can have many
options specified, to show them all use:

$ ./configure --help
